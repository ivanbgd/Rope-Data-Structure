Output:

How does it work?

First, we input numOps, which is 3.
Than, we input the three operations, which give:

Heeveryllo !body
Hello every!body
Hello everybody!


Each operation consists of i, j & k, which are described in the source file.

Constraints:
0 <= i <= j <= n - 1
0 <= k <= n - (j - i + 1)
